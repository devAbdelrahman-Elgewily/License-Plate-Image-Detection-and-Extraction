# 🚗 License Plate Detection with OpenCV & Machine Learning

This project implements an automatic **License Plate Detection** system using **OpenCV**, image processing techniques, and a trained **Machine Learning** model. The goal is to detect and extract vehicle license plates from images.

## 🔍 Project Overview

- Detects license plates from images using contour detection and filtering techniques
- Uses OpenCV for image processing: grayscale conversion, thresholding, edge detection
- Optional character segmentation and recognition for full pipeline
- Can be extended to support real-time detection via webcam or video streams

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- (Optional) Scikit-learn / Keras (for character recognition if implemented)
